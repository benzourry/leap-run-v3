# About LEAP App Builder

**LEAP App Builder** is a web-based application development platform designed to streamline the creation of modern web apps. It is powered by three core components:

- **LEAP-IO** – The backend engine that powers data processing and API services  
- **LEAP-DESIGN** – A no-code editor for designing app logic and UI  
- **LEAP-RUN** – The runtime engine that executes and renders the app in real time

LEAP App Builder adopts a **building block** and **metadata-driven** approach, allowing apps to be constructed from reusable components. By leveraging a technology-agnostic metadata format, applications built with LEAP remain compatible and up-to-date with the evolving LEAP runtime — without requiring manual intervention from developers.
