# About LEAP App Builder

**LEAP App Builder** is a web-based application development platform designed to streamline the creation of modern web apps. It is powered by three core components:

- **LEAP-IO** ‚Äì The backend engine that powers data processing and API services  
- **LEAP-DESIGN** ‚Äì A no-code editor for designing app logic and UI  
- **LEAP-RUN** ‚Äì The runtime engine that executes and renders the app in real time

LEAP App Builder adopts a **building block** and **metadata-driven** approach, allowing apps to be constructed from reusable components. By leveraging a technology-agnostic metadata format, applications built with LEAP remain compatible and up-to-date with the evolving LEAP runtime ‚Äî without requiring manual intervention from developers.

## Available Instances

As of now, there are **six active instances** of the LEAP App Builder platform:

1. **LEAPMY** ‚Äì Public and community instance  
2. **IA** ‚Äì Privately managed by UNIMAS  
3. **AA** ‚Äì Privately managed by UNIMAS  
4. **IREKA** ‚Äì Commercial installation by UNIMAS  
5. **AppWizard** ‚Äì Privately managed by Sarawak Skills  
6. **KBORNEO** ‚Äì Privately managed by ICATS University College
